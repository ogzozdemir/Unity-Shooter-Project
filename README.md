# Unity-Shooter-Project

Welcome to my first FPS game​​ I quickly created with the aim of expanding my portfolio. The game is quite short and simple. Our goal is to kill enemies, yes, just that.

**Features:**

- Player's FPS Controller (of course)
- Firefight with enemies (enemy pathfinding with navmesh)
- Pistol animations and bullet shell casing ejection (animations were made by me)
- Interaction with objects (health and ammo packs)
- Object pooling
- Camera shake and particle effects
- Sound effects

<sub>I couldn't upload the enemy model because of its size. So, if you are going to clone this repository, please add the model of your choice :)</sub>
