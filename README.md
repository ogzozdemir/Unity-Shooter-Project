# Unity-Shooter-Project

Welcome to my first FPS game with the aim of expanding my portfolio quickly. The game is quite short and simple. Our goal is to kill enemies, yes, just that.

**Features:**

- Player's FPS Controller (of course)
- Firefight with enemies (enemy pathfinding with navmesh)
- Pistol animations and bullet shell casing ejection (only the animations made by me)
- Interaction with objects (health and ammo packs)
- Camera shake and particle effects
- Sound effects

<sub>I couldn't upload the enemy model because of its size. So, if you are going to clone this repository, please add the model of your choice :)</sub>
